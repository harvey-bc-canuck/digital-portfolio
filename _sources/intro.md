````{tab-set}
```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Learned how to create citations and refer to the `references.bib` file, made possible by the `bibtex_bibfiles: - references.bib` line in `_config.yml`.
- Learned how to hide code. I did not use a tag; rather, I updated the code manually.
- Learned how to create my own Jupyter Notebook and update it locally.
```

```{tab-item} Things I Found Difficult
- Struggled with advanced references such as adding `{bibliography}` to allow citations to show; it is not obvious based on guidance.
- Faced challenges setting up and troubleshooting Jupyter Book builds as I could not get Python to work on the `.ipynb` file initially.
- Faced challenges updating/hiding code to ensure there were no hiccups.
